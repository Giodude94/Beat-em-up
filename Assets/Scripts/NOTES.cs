   // Find a way to implement a way to pick up a certain pickup and associate that with an object in an inventory that will be on the character.
   // Or see if you can change the scripts of pick ups stored in the inventory so that it can double down as the projectile that will be spawned.


    //The character should not move once it has attacks. In beat 'em ups the player does not move once they start attacking.
    //The chain should not continue if there is no target in front of the player. Should just repeat the first attack in the chain if there is no target.


   //Could set int the animation to not take any input from the Horizonatal axis as a means of stopping the char when attacking.
